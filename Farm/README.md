# Farm Project Overview

This is an educational project called **Farm**. The project contains multiple entities that interact with each other and have clear associations.  

Key points:

- **Configurations and Design:** Config files and classes follow GRASP principles, such as **Pure Fabrication**, to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.  
- **Abstract Classes:** Template abstract classes are used as base classes. We extend them to add new functionality or modify certain parameters.  
- **Scale:** The project contains **50 classes** and approximately **150 methods**.  
- **Design Principles:** The code adheres to **SOLID** and **GRASP** principles, ensuring clean, modular, and maintainable design.  
- **Testing:** Over **80% of the code** is covered with **XUnit tests**, ensuring reliability and correctness.
